# CalHacks-Pictures
Pictures for 2019 CalHacks

~The project I worked on was a a battle royale with pictures instead of guns.
The pictures here are of my project and journey through my first hackathon with a teammate who actually went to 
UCBerkeley.

Picture Context;
1)  Some hills we saw on the car ride to UC Berkeley
2)  A blurry building that I thought was cool half way up the hill to the stadium.
3)  The Registration line and outside of the stadium.
4)  Opening Ceremony
5)  Useful tools links for my project
6)  Ryan Matsumoto, a Google employee, giving the Google cloud platform workshop.
7)  My backpack and the city skyline
8)  The hall learing to the elevator. I walked this think atleast 100 times. 
    To the left are all the sponsor desks and mentor/director desks.
9)  Hackers working on their projects. This is half of the desks on the second floor(smallest floorspace)
10) A model of the stadium. 
11) Me setting up shop at the workstation that will become my home for the rest of the hackathon, 4th floor.
12) Me, on a little picnic for lunch.
13) Closeup of my lunch.
14) Another workshop I went to. This one is intro to Android Development. 
15) A beautiful sunset through the trees, taken
16) This is right infront of the food distribution area. Bless Lisa and Douglass Goldman.
17) Me trying to multitask...
18) The setup for an all nighter on the last night. (I slept the whole car ride back.)
    I had 4 pieces of 50mg caffeine chocolate, a redbull, and a monster energy.
    Totalling up to ~360 mg of caffeine in 8 hours. Would do again xD 
19) Me in a CalHacks blanket listening to music at 3 am.
20) Morning of the Demo Day.
21) The stadium in the morning.
22) Another shot of the stadium as it is quite impressive.
23) The setup after half the people have left already.
24) My partner came back and we did some more end connections right before demoing.
25) There are just so many gorgeous views from some of the upper floors.
26) You can see so far in this picture and I thought it was good to include it twice ;)
27) The golden gate bridge can be seen from the stadium. INSANE!
28) People setting up their demos.
29) Our Demo setup. Right laptop has a barcode to show the hit mechanic and left (me) has google
    cloud platform open to show back end mechanics.
